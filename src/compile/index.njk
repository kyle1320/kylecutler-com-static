            This is a place for me to put information about various projects I've worked on.
            This could be anything from screenshots and descriptions to working demos.

            This site is very much a work in progress, so check back often!

            My name is Kyle Cutler, I'm a fourth-year Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology.

            I have been programming for about six years, and I learn more every day. At the moment, I consider myself fluent in Java, Python, C, and JavaScript, but I have dabbled in many other languages as well.

        <p>
            I love to create visual programs, such as fractal generators, simulations, games, and anything else I come up with. (check out <a href="/projects/js/index.html">my JavaScript programs!</a>)

        <p>
            My other hobbies include playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" target="_blank">Go</a>, attending hackathons, practicing guitar, and cooking.
