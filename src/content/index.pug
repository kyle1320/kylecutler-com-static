      | I have been programming for about six years, and I learn more every day. At the moment, I consider myself fluent in Java, Python, C, and JavaScript, but I have dabbled in many other languages as well.
    p
      | I love to create visual programs, such as fractal generators, simulations, games, and anything else I come up with. (check out <a href="/projects/js">my JavaScript programs!</a>)

      | My other hobbies include playing
