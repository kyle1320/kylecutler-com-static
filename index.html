                My name is Kyle Cutler, I'm a second-year Computer Science student at Rochester Institute of Technology.

                I have been programming for about four years, and I learn more every day. At the moment, I consider myself fluent in Java, Python, C, and JavaScript, but I have dabbled in many other languages as well.
            </p>
            <p>
                I love to create visual programs, such as fractal generators, simulations, games, and anything else I come up with. (check out <a href="/projects/js/index.html">my JavaScript programs!</a>)
            </p>
            <p>
                My other hobbies include playing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_(game)" target="_blank">Go</a>, attending hackathons, practicing guitar, and cooking.
